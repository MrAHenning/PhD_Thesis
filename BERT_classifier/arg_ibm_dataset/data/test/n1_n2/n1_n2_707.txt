Race-conscious affirmative action remains necessary to address race-based obstacles President Lyndon B. Johnson elaborated on the importance of affirmative action to achieving true freedom for African Americans: .   "Nothing is more freighted with meaning for our own destiny than the revolution of the Negro American..In far too many ways American Negroes have been another nation: deprived of freedom, crippled by hatred, the doors of opportunity closed to hope..But freedom is not enough. You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair..This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil rights.

We seek not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result..To this end equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not enough [REF
