induced abortion is the deliberate and unjust killing of the embryo in violation of its right to life A seminal essay by Don Marquis argues that abortion is wrong because it deprives the embryo of a valuable future [REF]. Marquis begins by arguing that what makes it wrong to kill a normal adult human being is the fact that the killing inflicts a terrible harm on the victim. The harm consists in the fact that ‘when I die, I am deprived of all of the value of my future’:[REF] I am deprived of all the valuable ‘experiences, activities, projects, and enjoyments’ that I would otherwise have had [REF]. Thus, if a being has a highly valuable future ahead of it—a ‘future like ours’—then killing that being would be seriously harmful and hence seriously wrong [REF]. But then, as a standard embryo does have a highly valuable future, killing it is seriously wrong [REF]. And so ‘the overwhelming majority of deliberate abortions are seriously immoral’—‘in the same moral category as killing an innocent adult human being’ [REF
