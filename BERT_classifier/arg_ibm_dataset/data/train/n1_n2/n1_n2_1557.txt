existence must be due to an agent cause In the scholastic era, Aquinas formulated the "argument from contingency", following Aristotle in claiming that there must be something to explain why the Universe exists. Since the Universe could, under different circumstances, conceivably not exist (contingency), its existence must have a cause â€“ not merely another contingent thing, but something that exists by necessity (something that must exist in order for anything else to exist) [REF]. In other words, even if the Universe has always existed, it still owes its existence to an Uncaused Cause,[REF] Aquinas further said: "..and this we understand to be God."[REF
