The situation in Gaza is unsustainable and unacceptable In January and February 2011, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) conducted an assessment of the effects of the measures to ease the access restrictions [REF]. They concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in peopleâ€™s livelihoods [REF].   They found that a limited reactivation of the private sector resulted from the increased availability of consumer goods and some raw materials but the "pivotal nature of the remaining restrictions" and the effects of three years of strict blockade prevented a significant improvement in livelihoods [REF]. Although the unemployment rate in Gaza fell from 39.3% to 37.4% in the second half of 2010 there were significant food price rises [REF]. There was little or no improvement in food insecurity rates in Gaza which continued to affect 52% of the population [REF]. Few of the 40,000 housing units needed to replace homes lost during Operation Cast Lead and for natural population growth could be built as a result of the ongoing restrictions on importing building materials [REF]. The approval of over 100 projects funded by international organizations intended to improve the "extremely deteriorated" water and sanitation, education and health services, followed the easing of the blockade [REF]. The implementation of these projects was delayed by the entry approval process for materials and the limited opening of the Karni crossing [REF
