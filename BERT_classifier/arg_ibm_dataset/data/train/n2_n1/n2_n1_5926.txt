In his 1985 book Regular Economic Cycles: Money, Inflation, Regulation and Depressions, Ravi Batra argues that a growing concentration of wealth, measured as the 'share of wealth held by the richest 1 percent', is linked to bank failures and depressions. In Table 1 on page 127, there is data for this measure for the years 1810-1969, showing a rise in this measure prior to the 1929 stock market crash. "..as the concentration of wealth rises, the number of banks with relatively shaky loans also rises. And the higher the concentration, the greater is the number of potential bank failures." Batra predicted the same would happen if the 1% share rose again inequality is harmful for economic development
