Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources [REF]. A significant proportion of drugs are derived, directly or indirectly, from biological sources: at least 50% of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market are derived from plants, animals, and micro-organisms, while about 80% of the world population depends on medicines from nature (used in either modern or traditional medical practice) for primary healthcare [REF]. Only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential Earth's surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use
