Between 1987 and 1990, David McDowall found that guns were used in defense during a crime incident 64,615 times annually [REF]. This equates to two times out of 1,000 incidents (0.2%) that occurred in this time frame [REF]. For violent crimes (assault, robbery, and rape), guns were used 0.83% of the time in self-defense [REF criminal use of guns is far more common than self-defense use of guns
