Israel's inhuman blockade of Gaza represents a threat to regional peace and stability On 31 May 2010 the Israeli Navy seized an aid convoy of six ships known as the "Gaza Freedom Flotilla" [REF]. aiming to break through the blockade. The flotilla had declined an Israeli request to change course to the port of Ashdod, where the Israeli government had said it would inspect the aid and deliver (or let humanitarian organizations deliver) Israeli-approved items to Gaza [REF].   Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos boarded the ships from speedboats and helicopters launched from three missile ships. On the MV Mavi Marmara, the main ship of the convoy, passengers fiercely resisted the boarding with makeshift weapons and live fire, including from guns seized from soldiers. Passengers managed to capture three soldiers [REF]. After failing to disperse the activists using non-lethal means, the soldiers resorted to live fire. On other ships, soldiers were met with passive resistance which was easily suppressed with non-lethal techniques. Nine passengers were killed and dozens wounded. Nine soldiers were also injured, two of them seriously. All of the ships were seized and towed to Ashdod, while passengers were imprisoned in Israel and then deported to their home countries [REF]. [REF][REF][REF][REF] The MV Rachel Corrie, a seventh ship that had been delayed, set sail from Malta on the same day of the flotilla's interception. Israeli naval vessels shadowed the Rachel Corrie, and after it ignored three warnings, Israeli commandos boarded the ship from speedboats, arrested the crew, and forced it to sail to Ashdod [REF
