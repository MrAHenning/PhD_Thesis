Israel's attacks represent a severe and massive violation of the International Humanitarian Law Deputy Permanent Representative of Iceland to the UN made the following statement before the Security Council: "My country has condemned the killings of civilians and aligns itself with the Secretary-General of the UN as well as those member states which have called upon Israel to stop immediately its military actions in this densely populated area. Iceland has also condemned the firing of rockets from Gaza to terrorise Israeli civilians. Hamas bears a heavy responsibility for drawing civilians into the conflict zone. However, Israel's actions in Gaza, the past two weeks, are both disproportionate and clearly contrary to international humanitarian law."[REF
