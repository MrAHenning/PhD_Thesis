Statement also said that the Government "believes that the massive and disproportionate attacks by Israel to the Gaza Strip are in violation of international humanitarian law, exacerbating the already difficult humanitarian situation of the people civilians in the territory, exacerbate tensions in the sub-region and create a climate conducive to the development of extremism."[REF
