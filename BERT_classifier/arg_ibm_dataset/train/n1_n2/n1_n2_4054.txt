the disproportionate use of force by Israel, which causes suffering to the civilian population, can be neither understood nor justified On January 11, the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, Hussain Haroon, called for an immediate ceasefire and calm.

He said that those act, in their totality, constituted war crimes and crimes against humanity
