The offence of blasphemous libel is believed by some to be contrary to the freedom of speech In 2002, a deliberate and well-publicised public repeat-reading of the poem The Love that Dares to Speak its Name by James Kirkup took place on the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square and failed to lead to any prosecution by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

"We have won an important victory for free speech and the right to protest", declared human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell
