In their study for the World Institute for Development Economics Research, Giovanni Andrea Cornia and Julius Court published in 2001 reach policy conclusions on optimal distribution of income -- that it should be neither too high nor too low [REF]. They conclude that too much equality (below a Gini coefficient of .25) negatively impacts growth due to "incentive traps, free-riding, labour shirking, [and] high supervision costs". They also claim that high levels of inequality (above a Gini coefficient of .40) negatively impacts growth, due to "incentive traps, erosion of social cohesion, social conflicts, [and] uncertain property rights". They advocate for policies which put equality at the low end of this "efficient" range a certain amount of redistribution would be justified
