Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Phandu Skelemani said "The Botswana position is that we don't need war. War has never brought any solution to problems. The downside about war is that it affects innocent elderly people, women and children, not those who initiate it." He emphasised Botswana's view that both parties "must learn to talk" to resolve their differences and that "If people have mouths and brains but decide to fight, then there is real poverty in their thinking. Neither Israel nor Gaza will disappear if both parties engage in dialogue, as opposed to war."[REF the military solution won't conduct to peace
