1.1.1,"Controversies over video games often center on topics such as video game graphic violence , sex and sexism , violent and gory scenes , partial or full nudity , portrayal of criminal behavior , racism , and other provocative and objectionable material ."
2.1.1,Video games have been studied for links to addiction and aggression .
2.2.1,Earlier meta - analyses -LRB- an analysis of several studies -RRB- were conflicting .
2.3.1,A 2001 study found that exposure to violent video games causes at least a temporary increase in aggression and that this exposure correlates with aggression in the real world.
2.4.1,A decrease in prosocial behavior -LRB- caring about the welfare and rights of others -RRB- was also noted .
2.5.1,Another 2001 meta-analyses using similar methods and a more recent 2009 study focusing specifically on serious aggressive behavior concluded that video game violence is not related to serious aggressive behavior in real life.
3.1.1,Many potential positive effects have been proposed .
3.2.1,Recent research has suggested
3.2.2,"some violent video games may actually have a prosocial effect in some contexts , for example , team play"
4.1.1,It has been argued there is generally a lack of quality studies which can be relied upon and that the video game industry has become an easy target for the media to blame for many modern day problems.
4.2.1,"The most recent large scale meta-anlysis-- examining 130 studies with over 130,000 subjects worldwide-- concluded that exposure to violent video games causes both short term and long term aggression in players and decreases empathy and prosocial behavior."
4.3.1,"However, this meta-analysis was severely criticized in the same issue of the same journal for a number of methodological flaws, including failure to distinguish clinically valid from unstandardized aggression measures and for failing to solicit studies from researchers who have questioned whether causal links exist, thus biasing the sample of included studies."
5.1.1,"The Entertainment Software Association states that 20% of video game players are boys under the age of 17, 26% are over 50 (regardless of gender), and that the average game player is 37."
6.1.1,"In a survey of 1,102 teenagers aged 12 to 17, 97% of them said that they play video games; moreover, half of the survey respondents said that they had played a video game in the last day."
6.2.1,Three-quarters of parents who were surveyed said that they check the ratings on their kid's games.
6.3.1,"However , half of the boys"
6.3.2,were asked about their favorite game
7.1.1,"The adult demographic is the fastest - growing segment of the American video games market with 32 % of adults playing video games ,"
7.1.2,critics have suggested
7.1.3,such statistics are often used
7.1.4,to deflect from the fact
7.1.5,almost all American children are exposed to video games
8.1.1,"As of 2011 , over 40 % of players are female ."
8.2.1,"However, a 1998 study conducted at the University of Central Florida found that of the 33 games sampled, 41% do not feature female characters, 28% portrayed women as sex objects, 21% depicted violence against women, and 30% did not represent the female population at all."
8.3.1,"Furthermore, characterizations of women tended to be stereotypical: highly sexualized (""visions of beauty with large breasts and hips""), dependent (""victim or as the proverbial 'Damsel in Distress'""), opposed (""evil or as obstacles to the goal of the game""), and trivial (""females depicted [..] in fairly non-significant roles"")."
9.1.1,"However, this report has been criticized for not representing a wide range of video games, and that the games analysed, being up to 20 years old, do not represent the current status of the video game industry, and that strong female characters are now increasingly more prevalent."
10.1.1,One of the most common criticisms of video games is
10.1.2,they increase the violent tendencies among youth
10.2.1,"However , several major studies by groups such as The Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health , The Journal of Adolescent Health , and The British Medical Journal have shown no conclusive link between video game usage and violent activity . """
10.3.1,"One study did find an increase in reports of bullying, noting, ""Our research found that certain patterns of video game play were much more likely to be associated with these types of behavioral problems than with major violent crime such as school shootings."
10.4.1,"One of the first widely accepted controversial video games was developer Exidy 's 1976 title Death Race ,"
10.4.2,in which
10.4.3,players controlled cars

10.5.1,The game caused such an outcry
10.5.2,it was pulled from store shelves and profiled on 60 Minutes

10.8.1,Senator Joe Lieberman conducted hearings during the 1990s regarding
10.8.2,"he referred to as "" violent video games """
10.8.3,", in his opinion , included such games as Mortal Kombat"
10.9.1,"His sentiments have been echoed by certain researchers, such as Dr. Craig A. Anderson who testified before the Senate, ""Some studies have yielded nonsignificant video game effects, just as some smoking studies failed to find a significant link to lung cancer."
10.10.1,"But when one combines all relevant empirical studies using meta-analytic techniques it shows that violent video games are significantly associated with: increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased pro-social (helping) behavior."""
10.11.1,Anderson himself was later criticized in a 2005 video game court case for
10.11.2,to cite research
10.11.3,differed from his view
11.1.1,"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is an example of a video game that caused controversy, over and above the debate surrounding the violent gameplay, for allegedly encouraging racist hate crimes."
11.2.1,"The game takes place in "" Vice City "" , a fictionalized Miami , in 1986 , and involves a gang war between Haitians and Cuban refugees , with the player 's character"

12.2.2,"the term "" murder simulator "" to describe first - person shooter games"
12.3.1,"He argues that video game publishers unethically train children in the use of weapons and, more importantly, harden them emotionally to the act of murder by simulating the killing of hundreds or thousands of opponents in a single typical video game."
12.4.1,"Grossman 's conclusions have been criticized by some scholars , however , as highly selective and misleading ."
13.1.1,violent video games may increase mild forms of aggressive behavior in children and young adults
13.2.1,Analyses also showed
13.2.2,"exposure to violent video games results in increased physiological arousal , aggression - related thoughts and feelings as well as decreased prosocial behavior"
13.3.1,"The research comprised a meta analysis , laboratory and field studies ."
13.4.1,However meta-analyses by other groups have not replicated these findings  and these other groups have been critical of attempts to link violent games with aggression.
13.5.1,"For instance John Sherry has said -LRB- 2007 -RRB- "" Further ,"
13.5.2,do some researchers -LRB- e.g.

14.2.1,"compared the effects of violent video games to those of smoking on lung cancer This view has been challenged , however ."
14.3.1,"For instance, Ferguson (2010) has ruled out a relationship between video game violence and serious aggression, concluding ""Taken together these meta-analyses range from those which argue against meaningful effects to those which find weak effects."
14.4.1,Thus the debate on video game violence has been reduced to

15.1.2,violence in video games is not causally linked with aggressive tendencies

15.4.1,"Some may not be happy with that, but that’s where the science is."""
15.5.1,"A meta - analysis by psychologist Jonathan Freedman ,"
15.5.2,reviewed over 200 published studies and found
15.5.3,"that the "" vast and overwhelming majority "" did not find a causal link"
15.6.1,violent books and 27 % were attracted to violent films
15.7.1,An Australian study found
15.7.2,only children already predisposed to violence were affected by violent games
15.8.1,A recent long - term outcome study of youth found no long - term relationship between
15.8.2,playing violent video game and youth violence or bullying
16.1.1,A recent longitudinal study of youth in Germany found
16.1.2,aggressive children tend
16.1.3,"to select more violent video games , not the inverse"
16.2.1,violent games are psychologically harmful to minors
16.3.1,other studies may have found spurious effects due to
16.3.2,"focusing on youth self - report of aggression rather than reports by parents or teachers , the so called "" single responder bias """
17.1.1,In Grand Theft Childhood : The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and
17.1.2,"Parents Can Do , researchers / authors Lawrence Kutner , PhD , and Cheryl K. Olson , ScD"
17.2.1,"The researchers' study shows that adolescents that don't play video games at all are most at-risk for violent behavior (but without statistical significance), claiming that video game play is part of an adolescent boy's normal social setting."
17.3.1,"However , they do not completely deny violent -LRB- M - rated -RRB- video games ' negative influences on pre-teens and teenagers ."
17.4.1,Kutner and Olson say the views of both alarmists and the video game industry are often supported by flawed or misconstrued studies.
17.5.1,"The real risks according to them are not just about exposure to violence ,"
17.5.2,gore and sex but are more subtle with some children at greater risk than others
18.1.1,Official records show
18.1.2,"violent crime rates have declined dramatically since the early 1990s in the USA , among both juveniles and adults"
18.2.1,This is despite sales of violent video games exploding and their content becoming increasingly graphic during the same period .
18.3.1,"Video game violence is not the primary contributor to societal violence , however ,"
18.3.2,there are many other factors at play
19.1.1,According to media
20.1.1,Fears have been expressed about exposure to violent video games .
20.2.1,"For example, politicians and other people and organizations have considered video games effects on society, where the causative factor was not clear, ""there has been some fears specially from UK news service that hijackers may have used flight simulator software to practice flying jet planes, also, Beam Breakers removed all references to the World Trade Center already used in the game 1""."
21.1.1,"Some researchers believe that while playing violent video games leads to violent actions, there are also biological influences that impact a person's choices."
21.2.1,"According to Sean P. Neubert of Rochester Institute of Technology, a person who is biologically predisposed to aggression will be more strongly influenced by violent scenes and thus will have a greater risk for carrying out destructive actions."
21.3.1,For example someone with antisocial personality disorder has a greater risk of
21.3.2,going out and shooting someone after
21.3.3,playing hours of Grand Theft Auto or a game of a similar nature
22.1.1,Other biological theories of aggression and violence have specifically excluded video game and other media effects .
22.2.1,a factor to have much influence
23.1.1,Sexual themes in video games are much less tolerated in the US than violent themes; the most well-known example of this is the Hot Coffee controversy.
23.2.1,"In June 2005 , an entire portion of unused code was found within the main script of Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas , allowing the player"
23.2.2,to simulate sex with the main character 's girlfriends
23.3.1,"The game could be accessed in the PC version via a mod , and through Action Replay codes in the PS2 and Xbox versions ."
23.4.1,"The fact that the scene was left on the disc, and could be accessed by altering a few bytes of the game's code via a hex editor, prompted the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) to change the rating of San Andreas to ""Adults Only"" on July 20, 2005."
23.5.1,The game was pulled from many stores; Rockstar Games posted a loss of $28.8 million that quarter.
23.6.1,"The most controversial video game of this nature was Rapelay , a game revolving around rape ."
23.7.1,Worldwide public campaigns against it led to the game being banned .
24.1.1,Almost no North American video games display full frontal nudity .
24.2.1,"Sexual themes are more common in Japanese PC games, but console companies such as Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony do not license adult-only content games for their systems."
25.1.1,Bias of gender exists in games .
25.2.1,Terry Flew writes
25.2.2,generally representations of gender in digital games are stereotyped
25.3.1,"In many games, male characters are portrayed as hard bodied, muscled men, and female characters are portrayed as soft bodied, nearly naked women with large breasts."
25.4.1,"In addition , Flew also believes"
25.4.2,female characters in games are usually portrayed in a narrowly stereotypical manner
25.5.1,Females are usually constructed as visual objects
25.5.2,wait for male rescue and need
25.5.3,"to be protected ,"
25.5.4,men are portrayed with more power
25.6.1,Such depiction of females in games reflects underlying social ideas of dominance of male over female and themes of masculinity .
25.7.1,"Although not all video games contain such stereotypes, there are enough to make it a general trait."
25.8.1,"Ultimately , Flew ends with the statement of the broad demographic 's excessive demands , in that ' . ."
25.8.2,different genders have different gaming
25.9.1,' .
26.1.1,"However , some video games do not conform to traditional gender roles such as the male being dominant and the female being submissive ."
26.2.1,"One such example would be the protagonist Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider video game series ,"
26.2.2,"is presented as a beautiful , clever , athletic , and brave English archaeologist - adventurer"
26.3.1,"Croft has achieved popularity with both males and females as an action heroine ,"
26.3.2,depending on
26.3.3,feminist perspective is applied
26.4.1,"Recently the emergence of female gamers and developers in the industry has led to changes in video games to accommodate this demographic; where Lara Croft is concerned, this has led to games developer Eidos remodelling the character for Tomb Raider: Legend, so that the character has a more believable figure and less skimpy outfits so as not to offend female gamers."
26.5.1,"Although many video games emphasize a hypermasculine identity for male characters, this may in fact reflect current gender roles and stereotypes found in Western society; whereas, video games originating from Asia often include androgynous male characters, influenced by anime, with thinner bodies, softer faces, big eyes and long hair, such as the iconic characters of Sephiroth in Final Fantasy VII and Link in the Legend of Zelda."
27.1.1,Reinforcement of sexist stereotypes has also been claimed as an effect of violent video games .
28.1.1,"Lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender -LRB- LGBT -RRB- characters have been depicted in some video games since the 1980s ."
28.2.1,"LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations by game companies, which are generally examples of heterosexism in that heterosexuality is normalized while homosexuality is subject to additional censorship or ridicule."
28.3.1,"Sexual orientation and gender identity have served a significant role in some console and personal computer games , with"
28.3.2,the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities
29.1.1,Over two hundred studies have been published which examine the effects of violence in entertainment media and which at least partially focus on violence in video games in particular.
29.2.1,"Some psychological studies have shown a correlation between children playing violent video games and suffering psychological effects ,"
29.2.2,many other studies find no such link causation
30.1.1,"In 2004 the American Psychological Association summarized the issue as ""Psychological research confirms that violent video games can increase children's aggression, but that parents moderate the negative effects."""
30.2.1,"A more recent press release by the APA in 2010 summarized recent research findings as ""Bad effects depend on certain personality traits; games can offer learning opportunities for others""."
30.3.1,"Craig Anderson has conducted meta-analysis of previous studies and claimed they have demonstrated five effects: ""increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased pro-social (helping) behavior""."
30.4.1,other studies have explicitly denied
30.4.2,such a connection exists
30.6.1,"More recently , Block and Crain -LRB- 2007 -RRB- claim"
30.6.2,"in a critical paper by Anderson -LRB- and his co-author , Bushman -RRB- , data was improperly calculated and produced fallacious results"
30.7.1,"Other meta-analyses by other groups, such as by Ferguson and Kilburn (2009) and Sherry (2007) have repudiated any links between video game violence and aggression, as have recent reviews by the Australian Government (2010) and the US Supreme Court (June, 2011)."
31.1.1,"After conducting a two-year study of more than 1,200 Middle School children about their attitudes towards video games, Harvard Medical School researchers Lawrence Kutner and Cheryl Olson found that playing video games did not have a particularly negative effect on the researched group."
32.1.1,"The portrayal of race in video games has also recently become an issue , seen in games such as the Grand Theft Auto series , 50 Cent : Bulletproof , and Def Jam : Fight for NY ."
32.2.1,"In 2009, the issue of race emerged with the release of Resident Evil 5, which has the player kill numerous African enemies, resulting in arguments from both sides of the issue."

32.4.2,it was revealed
32.4.3,""" Left 4 Dead 2 "" , set in New Orleans , would include African - American zombies"

56.1.2,he delivered a fatal blow to the stomach
56.1.3,tore her internal organs
56.1.4,she interrupted him
56.1.5,playing his Xbox
56.2.1,She died from internal bleeding after
56.2.2,"suffering 35 separate injuries including multiple bruises , rib fractures and brain damage ,"
56.2.3,were comparable to injuries suffered in a car crash
56.3.1,Alcock was jailed for life and must serve at least 21 years .
57.1.1,"In May 2010 , French gamer Julien Barreaux located and stabbed a fellow player"
57.1.2,had stabbed Barreaux on the game Counter-Strike
57.2.1,The judge at his trial called him

59.1.2,"releasing more than a hundred bullets with a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun , killing 6 people and wounding 17 others ,"
59.1.3,after which
59.1.4,he also killed himself
59.2.1,"A fair amount of attention was given to the fact that Van Der Vlis had been playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and to the alleged similarities between the events in Alphen a/d Rijn and the controversial ""No Russian"" mission in the game (also known as the 'Airport Massacre') where the player can choose to (or choose not to) partake in the killing of a large group of innocent people inside an airport terminal."
60.1.1,Several theoretical approaches have been applied to potential video game violence effects -LRB- or lack of effects -RRB- .
60.2.1,"These models compete ,"
60.2.2,to explain
60.2.3,video games may or may not have effects on players
61.1.1,"For example the Catalyst Model of aggression comes from a diathesis - stress perspective ,"
61.1.2,aggression is due to a combination of genetic risk and environmental strain
61.2.1,The Catalyst Model suggests
61.2.2,"stress , coupled with antisocial personalities is most salient in the creation of aggression"
61.3.1,The Catalyst Model does allow that proximal influences
61.3.2,such as
61.3.3,family or peers may influence aggressiveness
61.4.1,However the Catalyst Model specifically states
61.4.2,media influences are too weak and distant
61.4.3,to have much influence
62.1.1,"having an influence on people , proposing"
62.1.2,"a participant 's thoughts , feelings and physical arousal can be affected by simulated violence"
62.2.1,this creates an effect on an individual 's interpretation of an aggressive or violent act
63.1.1,The GAM claims
63.1.2,video games have both short - and long - term effects
63.3.1,"violent video games promote violent behavior , attitudes and beliefs by"
63.3.2,desensitizing an individual to aggression
64.1.1,"In response to concerns about video games , governments around the globe have enacted or attempted"
64.1.2,to enact legislation
64.1.3,"regulating , prohibiting , or outright banning video games"
64.2.1,"Similarly , support for video game and media regulation has been linked to moral panic ."
64.3.1,"To that end , different video game content rating systems have been introduced across the globe ."
65.1.1,Psychology professor Chris Ferguson discusses in an interview
65.1.2,these myths are perpetuated
65.2.1,"When asked to describe the nature of how negative propaganda is spread by activist against video games, Ferguson explained that many respected academics and elected officials develop apprehension towards the media in question and formulate disproportionate accusations of harm."
65.3.1,Those claims are out in the public
65.3.2,expert evidence proves
65.3.3,"them to be invalid ,"
65.3.4,it difficult
65.3.5,to withdraw from such allegations
65.4.1,Possible motivations for why activist claims are not retracted are “…there are certain financial incentives and political incentives.
65.5.1,It’s hard to get grant money arguing that something *isn’t* a problem…and some scholars take money from anti-media lobbying groups.
65.6.1,censorship regimen naturally intend
65.6.2,to be in charge of that regimen themselves ”
65.7.1,"Ferguson adds that present research on violence in video games confirms no valid link, “The best studies now coming out — those which take care to use well-validated clinical outcome measures and which carefully control for other important risk factors — provide no support for the belief that VVG contributes to youth violence”."
66.1.1,"Voluntary rating systems adopted by the video game industry, such as the ESRB rating system in the United States and Canada, as well as the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating system in Europe, that are aimed at informing parents about the types of games their children are playing (or are asking to play)."
66.2.1,Certain game publishers’ decision to have controversial games rated seems to show that they are not targeted at young children.
66.3.1,"They are rated by the ESRB as "" Mature "" -LRB- M -RRB- or "" Adults Only "" -LRB- AO -RRB- in the US , or given British Board of Film Classification -LRB- BBFC -RRB- ratings of 15 or 18 in the UK ."
66.4.1,The packaging notes
66.4.2,these games should not be sold to children
66.5.1,"In the US, ESRB ratings are not legally binding, but many retailers take it upon themselves to refuse the sale of these games to minors."
66.6.1,"In the United Kingdom (UK), the BBFC ratings are backed up by law, so it is actually illegal to sell the game to anyone under the indicated age, and many UK retailers go beyond that and also enforce the PEGI ratings, which are not backed up by law."
66.7.1,No video game console manufacturer has yet
66.7.2,to allow any game
66.7.3,"to be published in North America with the harshest ESRB rating , "" Adults Only "" , signaling"
66.7.4,the game is only appropriate for ages 18 years and up
66.8.1,"Additionally , no major retailers are willing"
66.8.2,to set aside shelf space for AO - rated games
66.9.1,"Although Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was given a rating of AO after widespread surfacing of an add-on originally deleted from the game, ""Hot Coffee,"" in which the player controls a fully clothed sexual encounter."
66.10.1,It was later fully removed and the game retained the M rating.
66.11.1,GTA San Andreas is the best selling game
66.11.2,to ever receive the AO rating
67.1.1,Ratings Enforcement Act introduced to the US House of Representatives in both the 109th Congress and 110th Congress
67.2.1,The proposed legislation would require an ID check for M - and AO - rated game purchases .
67.3.1,"The bill was not passed into law, and other proposed bills were stopped because of First Amendment violations."
68.1.1,"Although no law mandates ID checking for games with adult content, a 2008 secret shopper survey done by the Federal Trade Commission shows that video game retailers have voluntarily increased ID verification for M- and AO-rated games, and sales of those games to underage potential buyers have been reduced from 83% in 2000 to only 20% in 2008."
69.1.1,"In April 2011 , the Federal Trade Commission undercover shopper survey found"
69.1.2,video game retailers continue
69.1.3,to enforce the ratings by
69.1.4,allowing only 13 % of underage teenage shoppers
69.1.5,"to buy M - rated video games , a statistically significant improvement from the 20 % purchase rate in 2009"
69.2.1,"By contrast , underage shoppers purchased R - rated movies 38 % of the time , and unrated movies 47 % of the time ."
70.1.1,"On January 7 , 2009 , Representative Joe Baca of California ’s 43rd District introduced H.R."
70.3.1,This bill called for labels to be placed in a “clear and conspicuous location on the packaging” which states “WARNING: Excessive exposure to violent video games and other violent media has been linked to aggressive behaviour.” The proposed legislation mandated that all video games with an ESRB rating of T (Teen) or higher be subjected to the compulsory labelling.
70.4.1,"The press release accompanying the introduction of the bill referred to scientific studies from the Pediatrics Journal, Indiana University, University of Missouri and Michigan State University which pointed to a “neurological link between playing violent video games and aggressive behaviour in children and teenagers.” The proposed legislation was referred on to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection."
70.5.1,"On January 24 , 2011 ; Rep. Joe Baca reintroduced the Video Game Health Labelling Act as H.R."
70.7.1,The bill was once again passed onto the Subcommittee .
71.1.1,"On June 27 , 2011 , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association , cited video games as protected speech under the First Amendment ."
71.2.1,The case centered on a California law
71.2.2,to restrict sales of violent video games to minors
71.3.1,"The video game industry , led by the Entertainment Merchants Association and the Entertainment Software Association successfully obtained an injunction on the bill ,"
71.3.2,definition of violence defined by the California law was too vague
71.4.1,"This opinion was upheld in lower courts , and supported by the Supreme Court 's decision ."
71.5.1,"In the decision, the Court determined that there was no direct link between violent video games and their influence on children, in as much as compared to other types of media like television and pictures, and that they could not create a new class of restricted speech that is not applied to other forms of media."
72.2.1,It has been shown
72.2.2,"action video game players have better hand - eye coordination and visuo - motor skills , such as their resistance to distraction , their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability"
72.2.3,"to count briefly presented objects , than non-players"
73.1.1,"Video games also develop the individual 's intelligence , and in social games develop the social capabilities of the individual ."
74.1.1,Another way
74.1.2,in which
74.1.3,the usage of video games might provide a benefit
74.2.1,There is a study being conducted by Dr.Cheryl Olson and her team at Massachusetts General Hospital ’s -LRB- MGH -RRB- Center for Mental Health and Media and Harvard
74.2.2,to prove
74.2.3,violent games help
74.2.4,students deal with stress and aggression
74.3.1,She has found
74.3.2,over 49 % of boys and 25 % of girls use violent games such as Grand Theft Auto IV as an outlet for their anger
74.4.1,Dr. Olson has come to the conclusion
74.4.2,violent games affect students positively and not
74.4.3,negatively because
74.4.4,the violent crime rate is going down
74.4.5,the popularity of M - rated video games has increased
74.5.1,"She suggests that instead of stopping children from playing M-rated games completely, parents should just monitor how much time their children spend playing games; parents should take responsibility."
75.1.1,Several studies have explored the possible benefits of multiplayer video games in a family setting .
75.2.1,"The most recent study found that girls 11-16 who played video games with their parents had better mental health and less aggressive behavior, with a stronger connection if they played age-appropriate games."
76.1.1,Many studies have been done on gaming and its integration into the classroom in order
76.1.2,to support the educator
76.2.1,""" The use of gaming has the ability"
76.2.2,to actively involve students in learning
76.3.1,students build collaborative skills while
76.3.2,completing given tasks
77.1.1,"To date , video game training appears"
77.1.2,to be one of the more interesting and promising means
77.1.3,"to improve perceptual , attentional , and cognitive abilities"
77.2.1,One of its promises is
77.2.2,", compared to traditional training , it can be engaging and entertaining"
77.3.1,This has led some companies
77.3.2,to begin
77.3.3,to market video games for the specific purpose of
77.3.4,improving cognition
77.4.1,"For example , Nintendo advertises "" Big Brain Academy "" as a game"
77.4.2,"that """
77.4.3,"trains your brain with a course load of mind - bending activities across five categories : think , memorize , analyze , compute , and identify"
78.1.1,It enables players
78.1.2,to explore various aspects of their identity in a virtual world
79.1.1,"children gain problem solving abilities , perseverance , pattern recognition , hypothesis testing , estimating skills , inductive skills , resources management , logistics mapping , memory , quick thinking and reasonable judgements """
80.1.1,playing video games
80.1.2,contain high levels of action
81.1.1,"Many authors disagree with the notion that suggests that the media can cause violence, they propose media cannot cause violence because humans have the ability to recognize what is wrong, and what is right."
81.2.1,people are not going
81.2.2,to mistake fiction for reality
81.3.1,Some people
81.3.2,criticize the proposed negative effects based their research
82.1.1,J.C. Herz argued
82.1.2,"many so - called negative effects of video games , such as aggression and lack of pro-social behavior , are both necessary and useful traits"
82.1.3,to have in a capitalistic society
82.2.1,"Specifically , Herz argued"
82.2.2,"many academic researchers have an anti-capitalist bias , and thus failed"
82.2.3,to notice the benefits of such traits
83.1.1,they can be a safe outlet for aggression and frustration
